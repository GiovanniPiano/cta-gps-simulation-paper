I tried to find a spectral and morphological model for the SNR Gamma Cygni with CTA.
This SNR was detected in gamma rays by Fermi-LAT and VERITAS.
Between 100 MeV and a few GeV, the region is completely dominated by the emission from the PSR J2021+4026,
that shows a bright cut-off at E ~ 2.4 GeV.
According to Ackermann et. al, 2017 (ApJ 843,39), Fermi-LAT detected emission above 10 GeV from the whole extent of the
radio emitting sincrotron shell (~1 deg diamater). Nevertheless, by observing the TS map of the region, most of the
emission comes from the North-Western rim of the shell, where the TeV source, VER J2019+407, is located.

My hypothesis is that CTA will detect (above 100 GeV) emission from the whole shell of the SNR,
with a morphology very similar to the one detected by Fermi-LAT above 10 GeV.
I assumed, as spectral model, a broken power-law that is based on the VERITAS spectrum and the Fermi-LAT spectrum
from the whole SNR disk. The spectra have been published in a recent VERITAS paper, Abeysekara et al., 2018 (ApJ 861, 134).

The hypothesis on spectral and morphological models has been discussed with L. Tibaldo and A. Giuliani.

==== CTA SIMULATION (ctools) ====

The spectral model is shown in figure gammacygni.png (cyan curve). The input xml file is gammacygni.xml.

The morphological model was estracted from the TS Fermi-LAT map above 10 GeV of the region, for TS values greater than 36.

Figure GammaCygni_radio_fermi_CTA.png shows (from left to right) the radio syncrothron shell, the Fermi-LAT TS map (TS > 36) 
and the CTA map obtained with ctamapcube (0.1 - 100 TeV). All the images were obtained with a 3-pixel Gaussian smoothing.

I simulated 50h with CTA North. The file gamma_cygni_commands_fermi_template.txt reports the complete set of commands 
that I gave to ctools to carry out the analysis.

IRF: North_z20_average_50h
calibration database: prod3b-v1
binned analysis: 12 energy bins with energy dispersion
single source analysis (long computing time required)
TS = 6414.311
